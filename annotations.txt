- kestrel acts a server
- controllers classes must derives from ControllerBase
- the route template is defined by classname without suffix (i.e: ValuesController = /values)
- parameters in funcion that isn't in the route is considered query params
- the precedence order of parameters is important, because the first parameter will be the route 
  parameter (if you don't set the parameter as QueryParameter obviusly)
- [FromBody] attribute must be typed with class, using their properties to match payload expectations
- when you set a data annotation, DON'T FORGET about ModelState validation
- ActionResult is used to produce responses
- Content Negotiation: when client requests some information to server and server gives (if it can)
  the requested info for client
- The default content response is form-data
- to set input formatters, you need to set options by AddMvc() method. Thus, you need to set on headers
  the key Accept and the value application/xml to bring the xml response
- if you want to protect your response setting only one way to respond, you cat put Produces attribute
  in respective method
- to use DbContext you must add AddDbContext on ConfigureServices in Startup
